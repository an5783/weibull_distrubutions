# weibull_distrubutions
Have loaded in lidar data, generated frequency table, plotted this as a historgram against a Weibull fit,
after calculating shape parameter and scale factor from experimental data

Next aim is to figure out how to code in an equivalent to Excel's goal seek in order
to optimise the fit of the weibull distribution
